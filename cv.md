### Profile

I started learning coding with courses on [Stepik](https://stepik.org/cert/1049927). In October 2021 I began studying English. A student in my English group told me about RSschool. My goal for this course is to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and get skills of creating web-sites and applications.

### Skills

### Code example

```
#The function finds the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the passed string

def count_letters(s):
    n=0
    k=0
    for i in s:
        if i.isupper():
            n+=1
        elif i.islower():
            k+=1
    print(f'Number of uppercase letters: {n}')
    print(f'number of  lowercase letters: {k}')
